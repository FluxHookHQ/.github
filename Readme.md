### *Reliable Webhooks & Event Infrastructure — Coming Soon*

Welcome to **FluxHookHQ**.
We're currently building a modern, reliable, scalable platform for **webhook delivery**, **event routing**, and **workflow automation** — but the code and repos are still in development.

This organization will contain all components of the FluxHook ecosystem once work progresses.

---

## 📌 What We’re Building

FluxHook is planned to include:

* **Webhook Delivery Engine**
  Reliable, queue-backed webhook dispatch with retries & DLQ.

* **Event Router**
  Rule-based routing for filtering, transforming, forwarding events.

* **Workflow Engine**
  Multi-step workflows triggered by events.

* **Developer Tooling**
  SDKs, CLI tools, signing helpers, and testing utilities.

* **Infrastructure Templates**
  Deployment setups using Docker/Kubernetes + observability stack.

We are still setting up the architecture, backend structures, and initial codebases.
