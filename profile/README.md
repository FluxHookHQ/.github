# 🚧 FluxHookHQ

### <i>Reliable Webhooks & Event Infrastructure — Coming Soon</i>

Welcome to <b>FluxHookHQ</b>.  
We're currently building a modern, reliable, scalable platform for  
<b>webhook delivery</b>, <b>event routing</b>, and <b>workflow automation</b> —  
but the code and repos are still in development.

---

## 📌 What We’re Building

FluxHook is planned to include:

<b>• Webhook Delivery Engine</b><br>
Reliable, queue-backed webhook dispatch with retries & DLQ.

<b>• Event Router</b><br>
Rule-based routing for filtering, transforming, forwarding events.

<b>• Workflow Engine</b><br>
Multi-step workflows triggered by events.

<b>• Developer Tooling</b><br>
SDKs, CLI tools, signing helpers, and testing utilities.

<b>• Infrastructure Templates</b><br>
Deployment setups using Docker/Kubernetes + observability stack.

We are still setting up the architecture, backend structures, and initial codebases.
