# 🚧 FluxHookHQ  
### <i>Modern Webhook Infrastructure & Event Delivery — Coming Soon</i>

FluxHookHQ is an upcoming open-source platform designed to provide  
robust **webhook delivery**, intelligent **event routing**, and flexible **workflow automation**.  
The ecosystem is currently under active development, with repositories scheduled to be released soon.

<tr><td align="left">

**• Webhook Delivery Engine**  
Reliable, queue-backed delivery with retry logic, exponential backoff, and DLQ.

**• Event Router**  
Rule-driven routing for filtering, transformation, and multi-destination forwarding.

**• Workflow Engine**  
Event-triggered workflows and sequencing for automation and orchestration.

**• Developer Tooling**  
SDKs, CLI tooling, signature verification utilities, and local testing tools.

**• Infrastructure Templates**  
Production-ready Docker/Kubernetes setups, observability stack, and deployment blueprints.
